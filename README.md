# iTTFU
An ongoing project to create a comprehensive app to support the running of my college Ultimate Frisbee team's annual indoor intra-squad winter league.

This project is built around an activity that is very close to me. Every winter, my college Ultimate Frisbee team combines the entire men's and women's programs and picks 8 freshman captains to draft teams for a coed, competitive, and mostly fun frisbee league that takes place in the gym on Friday nights from Winter Break to Spring Break. The activity is named Friday Is The Time For Ultimate (FITTFU) and is the highlight of the year for many people. Stats are kept and fantasy leagues and fantasy points are often as hotly contested as their real counterparts.

The project is in progress and is clearly missing some important features but will hopefully be ready in time for next year's league

Features:
  - League Standings
  - League Schedule
  - Game Statistics
  - In-game Scorekeeping
  - Player cards
Not Yet Implemented:
  - Transitions
  - Backend/server implementation (via Parse)
  - Drafting
  - Fantasy league aspect
  - More detailed player-cards
  - More detailed/useful statistical views
