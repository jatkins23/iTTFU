Professor Kel√©yni,

This app is definitely not perfect with some interface issues, a few autolayout warnings, and is completely missing a backend (which would have been through Parse had there been more time and I not had other exams and projects to contend with), however, I feel I put a lot of effort into it and have definitely learned a ton over the course of working on this app and would like to spend much of my winter break working on iOS programming, including hopefully finishing this app. I hope you will take this into account and I welcome any and all suggestions on how to improve it. If you have any questions because the app is definitely not intuitive at the moment because it is missing some labels that I could not figure out how to include, please let me know so I can hopefully explain my reasoning and my issues. Thank you very much for a fascinating semester where I learned a lot about something I previously had no concept of and thank you very much for all of your help individually.
